# Orion Tri-Belt

![](Images/Orion.JPG)

A mod of a Voron Trident that replaces the 3 leadscrews with belts and modified Z-Drives from a 2.4.  This is in the very early stages of development and though a fully funtional printer has been built some of the parts are not yet fully tested.  The existing printer is producing excellent prints though many changes will be coming in the following months.  

This first version places the Low Voltage Electronics up top, though I do hope to create a version in the future which is more closely matched to a stock Trident Build.  The second version will have the Z drives and low voltage electronics located on the bottom as in a Voron 2.4.

A huge thank you to Clee for lots of help in planning, designing and generally supporting the development of this 3Dprinter.  

## Why?
Since this is the most common question when posting about this printer I will get this out of the way.  
  1. Much higher Z speeds and accelerations when compared to lead screws.  Tested so far at 200mm/s and 1000mm/s^2 without issues.
  2. Avoids the usual drawbacks of leadscrews regarding wobble and backlash.
  3. Similar cost to a trident with lead screws given the relativly high cost of Steppers with integrated lead screws.
  4. Why not?

The cost of this modification is approximatly $145 USD.  If the 3 Steppers with lead screws are not purchased the cost over a stock trident build is approximatly $40 USD.
